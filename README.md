- 👋 Hi, I’m @anthprestia
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# scripting and using Unity to create 2D games
- 📫 How to reach me:
      email:  anthprestia@gmail.com
      
-     I am currently still populating this page retroactively with different projects of mine.
-     A majority of my school projects are kept private by the school git account that I have no control over so I won't be able to publish them to my page.
